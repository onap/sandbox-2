/**
 * <H1>Env</H1>
 * <i>Env</i> is the basic representation of what can be obtained from the
 * Environment.  Environments also need the ability to Log and Track Time, so
 * to keep the interfaces clean, Env Interface inherits from Trans.  This does NOT
 * mean that all Environments are Transactions... It only means Environments need 
 * to Log and Track Times. 
 * .<p>
 * 
 * Using this abstraction, Components can be built on a modular basis,
 * and still have the essentials of functioning within the service mechanism.<p>
 * 
 * Thus, for instance, an Module could be made to work in two separate
 * service types, with substantial differences in choices of logging, or auditing,
 * and still have reasonably deep insight, such as the exact time a
 * remote service was invoked.<p>
 * 
 * There is a bit of an assumption corresponding to the reality of the 2000s that
 * XML plays a part in most service work.
