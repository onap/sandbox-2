 * This is a convenience class for those Objects which should
 * implement LifeCycle, but don't have anything to do in any of the 
 * LifeCycle methods defined. Extending
 * NullLifeCycle reduces the required methods for the class by 5.  
 * Any one or two of them can be overloaded.<p>
 * 
 * If more are overloaded, it is
 * recommended just to implement LifeCycle.
 * <p>
 * 
 * This only works, though, if the Object doesn't need to extend something
 * else, due to Java's Single Extension policy.  In other cases, just
 * implement LifeCycle, and leave them empty.
