 * This Class pools on an As-Needed-Basis any particular kind of class, which is
 * quite suitable for expensive operations.
 * 
 * The user calls "get" on a Pool, and if a waiting resource (T) is available,
 * it will be returned. Otherwise, one will be created with the "Creator" class
 * (must be defined for (T)).
 * 
 * You can Prime the instances to avoid huge startup costs
 * 
 * The returned "Pooled" object simply has to call "done()" and the object is
 * returned to the pool. If the developer does not return the object, a memory
 * leak does not occur. There are no references to the object once "get" is
 * called. However, the developer who does not return the object when done
 * obviates the point of the pool, as new Objects are created in place of the
 * Object not returned when another call to "get" is made.
 * 
 * There is a cushion of extra objects, currently defaulted to MAX_RANGE. If the
 * items returned become higher than the MAX_RANGE, the object is allowed to go
 * out of scope, and be cleaned up. the default can be changed on a per-pool
 * basis.
